# mapmaking
Maps, tilesets, and assets oh my!


## MAP GURU USAGE
1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/gathertown/mapmaking.git
( I put it in my local "Gather" directory as "mapmaking". )
2. Use some sort of git management program (I use Fork) or be a boss and go comand-line.
3. Before you start at the beginning of the day, Fetch.
4. If you make a change to the repo, Merge and Push.

## BASIC USAGE
1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/gathertown/mapmaking.git
2. Find the thing you want, assume it'll be up to date. Download it.
   ^ probably best for image files. If you're planning on modifying something, come use the repo!
If you have any questions or troubles, let me know.

Because all the tiled files (TMX / TSX) use relative paths, we're golden. Everything is self-contained in the repo, or even if you have side-projects that reference this repo, it should still work.

## Structure
### mapmaking
#### üìÅ maps
map files (.tmx) / background files (.png) / foreground files (.png) / photoshop files (.psd)
#### üìÅ tilesets
tileset files (.tml) and source files (.png)
#### üìÅ assets
asset files (.png) and photoshop source files (.psd)

## Tileset Naming Convention
### for tilesets (.tsx)
`Group Name #.#.tsx`
Where
- `Group` is likely "Gather"
- `Name` is the tileset name, like "Castle" or "University"
- `#` is the major version number. Like all versioning systems, the anything contained in a "major version" (to the left of the .) are compatable with themselves. Consider these small changes like little refinements or adding more items without moving anything around.
- `x` is literally "x"


### for tilesheets (".png")
`group_name_#.#.png`
- we should actually change the value incrementally, and point the corresponding tileset to this as it changes.
